Epson RC90 Controller with LS6 Manipulator

This is an experiment for open sourcing industrial robotic arm code. Please Note: please only experiment with open source robotic code if you have experience with these robots. They move very fast and can cause bodily harm. This code should be used for educational purposes only.  

The code in this repository is the sample code that came with the Epson RC+ 7.0 software. I am trying to collaborate with other engineers who are writing programs for these machines. I will continue to add programs that I have written please star if you want me to continue adding and discussing robotic machinery automation programs.
